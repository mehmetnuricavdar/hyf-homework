Chef John's Grilled Bacon Meatloaf Burgers
I love meatloaf, but not as much as I love meatloaf sandwiches. In fact, I'll make a meatloaf just for the leftovers. I'll fry the cold slice in a buttered pan until hot and crusty, and enjoy it on toast with ketchup. This recipe is basically that, plus bacon, in burger form.

Total Time: 3 hrs 20 mins
Ingredients
1 large egg, beaten

1 tablespoon ketchup

2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon brown sugar

½ teaspoon onion powder

¼ teaspoon garlic powder

pinch dried thyme

cayenne pepper to taste

¼ cup plain bread crumbs

⅔ cup chopped cooked bacon

1 pound ground chuck beef (85% lean)

Directions
Whisk egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add breadcrumbs and chopped cooked bacon. Crumble in the ground beef. Mix with your fingers until bacon and breadcrumbs are distributed evenly.

Form mixture into 4 burgers with your wet hands. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, about 3 hours.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Place burgers on the grate and cook, turing occasionally, until firm and cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let burgers rest for a few minutes before serving.

Cook's Note:
You can also pan fry these burgers to get a nice even crust.
